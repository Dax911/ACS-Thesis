# Stanford LaTeX Thesis Example

## About
The hope is that this example thesis saves you time that I (and countless others before me) wasted on the minutiae of writing a thesis in LaTeX. It combines a slightly modified version of the existing [Stanford thesis style](https://www.stanford.edu/dept/sul2/etdhelpupload/0/06/Suthesis-2e.sty) ([more Stanford information here](https://library.stanford.edu/research/bibliography-management/latex-bibtex-and-overleaf)) with a template for including figures, tables, inline references, equations, symbols, a bibliography, a signature page, etc... While I have made every attempt to ensure this adheres to Stanford's policies, there are absolutely no guarantees that your thesis will be accepted if it adheres this template. 

## Usage
1. Install LaTeX on your system, use a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dxjoke/tectonic-docker), or use an online service like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). I used Overleaf because compilation is fast and simple.
2. Clone / download this repository, upload the files to an online service if that is what you are using, and finish your thesis!
